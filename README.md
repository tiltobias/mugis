_A web-based GIS application built as part of the course [TBA4251 Programming in Geomatics](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TBA4251) at NTNU._

## 📌 Introduction

muGIS (μGIS) is an interactive online Geographic Information System (GIS) designed to work with GeoJSON data. It allows users to load GeoJSON FeatureCollection files or custom `.mugis` project files to visualize and analyze spatial data directly in the browser.

The application offers a variety of spatial analysis tools, including buffering, union, intersection, difference, dissolve, Voronoi diagrams, clipping, and bounding box calculations. These tools are powered by [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/), a modular geospatial analysis library.

Users can also inspect and manipulate attribute data through a built-in attribute table, enabling the creation of new layers from filtered selections using versatile query filters.

The map interface is built on [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) for high-performance, interactive mapping. Integration with [Mapbox GL Draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw) allows users to add new point, line, and polygon layers by drawing directly on the map. A layer list panel displays all active layers, with full control over their visualization.

Users can save the current state of their project to a `.mugis` file and later reload or reset it, providing a smooth workflow for iterative geospatial analysis.
